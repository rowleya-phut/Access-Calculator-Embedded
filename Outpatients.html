			<p>This course is designed for learners who need access to outpatients</p>
				<li>Note that there is a waiting list for staff wanting to go on this course.
				<li>Make sure when new courses are available to offer the dates to those on the list.</li>
				<li>Remember to record that offers were made on the student record.</li>
				<li>For staff members in Andrology, outpatient bookings are made using Healthcare System Wide (?) - training is through the HC1S course
		and results in HC1 and HCR function access.  This is because the clinics are NOT consultant led (so they act like other non-consultant led
		contacts such as physiotherapy).
				<li>OP2 and OPR are often requested at the same time, and you can treat them as one in the same thing. They are part of the Outpatient training, however, users can be granted access if they just need to see reports, but are not actually managing the patients.

				In some cases staff are able to get view-only access via SWO function to see waiting list for various departments.  
				However, SWO comes with the ability to add patients to a TCI (To Come In) list - so this is tricky and must go through 
				Clinical Applications. e.g. Adam Haycox
